Docker Engine Uses/definitions:-

Docker is an open-source centralised plarform designed to create, deploy and run.
It uses container on the host OS to run aplliciations. It allows applications to use the same linux kernel as a system on the host computer, rather than creatng a whole irtual O.S.
We can install dpcker on any O.S but docker engine runs natively on linux distribution.
It is written in go lanhguage.
It is a tool that performs OS level virtualisation, also known as containerization.
Befor docker, many users faces the problem that a particular code is rinning in the developer's system but not on the user's system.
It was forst released in march 2013. It is developed by Salomon Hykes & Sebastian Pahl.
It is a set of platform as a service that uses O.S level virtualization whereas VMware uses Hardware level virtualisation.



Disadvantages of Docker:
-----------------------
Docker is not a good soluytion for application that requires ricj GUI.
Difficult to manage large amoubt of containers.
It does not porvide cross-plarform compatibility menas if an application is designed to run in a docker container on windows, then it can't run on linux on vice-versa.
Docker is suitable when the development OS and the testing OS are same, if the OS are different then we should use VM.
No solution for dara recovery and backup.
