How to create docker image of our own?
First of all install any OS in my case it's Python using Ubuntu OS.

Install python: sudo yum install python.
> sudo yum install python: run python to see the version of the python installed.
> sudo yum install python flask using : sudo yum (-y) install python-flask.
> to run a web server for a simple application, copy the source code and create it : cat > /opt/app.py
> paste the source code that you have coppied after you hit enter button.
> follow the instructions given to run the application: FLASK_APP=app.py flask run --host=0.0.0.0


How to access the web server for the application that we have created?
We need to access through the IP address of docker to access internally and to access externally we need to map the ports.


Docker Images:
Docker image is a read-only tamplet composed of layered filesystems used to share common files and create Docker 
container instances.

Images layer always has their own image IDs which are always unique.


Why is docker images required?
It is because you are not able to find a component or services thatyou want to use as a part of your services on 
docker hub already or you and your team have decided that the app developing will be dockarised for shiping and deplotment.clear



How to run docker images for long in background?
docker run -it ubuntu bash for a longer time/ -i: standard input, t: terminal.





Docker:
Docker is a set of platform as a service products that uses OS-level virtualization to deliver software in packages
 called containers. Containers are isolated from one another and bundle their own software, libraries and 
 configuration files;they can communicate with each other through well-defined channels.

It is a tool designed to make it easier to create, deploy and run applications by using containers.
Docker containers are lightweight alternative for virtual machine and it uses the host OS.

Docker is a software platform for building applications based on containers ï¿½ 
small and lightweight execution environments that make shared use of the operating system kernel but otherwise run 
in isolation from one another.

Docker Containers:
A container is a standard unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies so the application runs 
quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another.

  
Docker Container Image:
A Docker container image is a lightweight, standalone, executable package of software that includes everything 
needed to run an application.


Docker utilises LXC container:
LXC is an operating-system-level virtualization method for running multiple isolated Linux systems on a control
 host using a single Linux kernel.



Basic-Commands-on-Docker:
Commmand to remove docker images by force: docker rmi -f image(name).
 
 Run Command: Used to run the commands.
 
 attach & detach commands:
 attach command is used to run the docker container in foregroumf and docker detach command is used to run the 
 docker container in backgroung.

rm is uesd to remove the container: eg, docker rm +container name or ID.& rmi is used to remove docker images,
 eg: docker rmi +images name ot ID.

docker pull command:
It pulls the images of the os but does not run it.

If we want to run the command inside the container than use the following:
1. Identify the container.
2. docker exec (container ID) cat /etc/*release*

TAG:latest
It is used to run the other versions of the OS. Ex: docker run redis 4.0 instead of the latest version 5.0.


exec runs a command inside the running container.

Docker has two editions:
Community & Enterprise Edition.
