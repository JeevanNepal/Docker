Docker Swarm
A Docker Swarm is a group of either physical or virtual machines that are running the Docker application and that
 have been configured to join together in a cluster. ... The activities of the cluster are controlled by a swarm 
 manager, and machines that have joined the cluster are referred to as nodes.
