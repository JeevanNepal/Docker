Docker Swarm
A Docker Swarm is a group of either physical or virtual machines that are running the Docker application and that
 have been configured to join together in a cluster. ... The activities of the cluster are controlled by a swarm 
 manager, and machines that have joined the cluster are referred to as nodes.

 It allows us to conbine multiple docker machines into a single cluster. It take care of application instances into 
 separate host for high availability & load balancing across different systems.

                                      Swarm Setup:

Docker swarm has 1 swarm manager and other workers, run docker swarm init command to initialize the swarm manager.

The output of the swarm command can be run to other workers swarm nodes to join the manager.


                                      Docker Service:

Docker services are one or more instances of a single application or service that runs across the nodes in the swarm                                        
cluster.


NOTE: docker service command must be run on the swarm mamager node and not on the worker nodes.

docker service create: It is the command to create docker services for which image name should be provided.
replicas=8, this is the number of instanxe which specifies to be runned on across the cluster.
