Docker Command arguments & Entrypoint.

Contaiers unlike the virtual machines are not mean to host the OS. It is mean to run a specific task or process.
Once the task is completed the container exists & container only live as long as the process inside is alive.

How to specify a different command to start a container rather ythan it's default one?
Just append a command to the docker run command in that way it overwrites the default docker command specified within the image.
