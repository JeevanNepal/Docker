Docker Command arguments & Entrypoint.

Contaiers unlike the virtual machines are not mean to host the OS. It is mean to run a specific task or process.
Once the task is completed the container exists & container only live as long as the process inside is alive.

How to specify a different command to start a container rather than it's default one?
Just append a command to the docker run command in that way it overwrites the default docker command specified within the image.

Eg,: docker run ubuntu
     docker run ubuntu sleep 5 sec.

How to make a container to run for permanently?
Say we always want to run the container with sleep command.

Command in shell form:                  Command is jason array format: 
CMD command and program ]               CMD sleep 5           
Command ["command","parameter1"]        CMD["sleep", "5"]

To change the sleep time just append the command: eg, : docker run ubuntu-sleeper sleeep 10 / docker run ubuntu-sleeper 10.
