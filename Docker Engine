Docker Engine is an open source containerization technology for building and containerizing your applications.
 Docker Engine acts as a client-server application with: A server with a long-running daemon process dockerd .
 APIs which specify interfaces that programs can use to talk to and instruct the Docker daemon.


It can be simply refered to a host docker installed on it.

When we install docker on a host we are actually installing three different components:
1. Docker Daemon
2. REST API Server
3. Docker client

1: Docker Daemon: It is a background processes that manages docker objects such as, docker images, containers, 
   volumes and networks.

2: REST API Server: It ia an API interface that programs can used to interact to deamon and provide instructions.
   Own tools can also be created using it.

3: Docker CLI: It's nothing but command line interface. 


CONTAINERIZATION:
Docker uses namespace to isolate work space.

Container sharing same resources:
cgroups: Docker uses cgroup(control groups) to restrict the amount of hardware resources allocated to each container.

docker run --cpus=.5 ubuntu: it can restrict the containers to take up only 50% of the host resources.
