A Dockerfile is a simple text file that contains the commands a user could call to assemble an image whereas 
Docker Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. 
Docker Compose define the services that make up your app in docker-compose.


Docker Compose installation process for linux:
sudo(only if not a super user)curl -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.26.2/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)" -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose

Now set the executable permission to the binary file: sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose

Create a docker compose file with the name docker-compose.yml


We will run the following for runing the application:

> first of all run the docker run command: docker run -d --name=redis redis.
> next we will deploy the postgres sql db by running the docker run postgres command: docker run -d --name=db postgres 9.4
> next run the front end app and run the instance of a voting app by running the instance of voting-app: docker run -d --name=vote -p 5000:80 --link redis:redis voting-app.
> next we will deploy the result web application that showa the results to the user: docker run -d --name=result -p 5001:80 --link db:db result-app
  result-app.
> finally we deploy hte worker by running hte instance of the worker image: docker run -d --name=worker --link redis:redis --link db:db worker.
> link is a commend line option which can be used to link two containers.



Now we need to identiy all the services required and list them:
redis:
  image: redis
  

db: 
  image: postgres
  

vote:
  image: voting-app
  ports: 
    - 5000:80
  links:
    - redis

worker:
  image: worker-app
  links:
    - db
    - redis  

result:
  image: result-app
  ports: 
    - 5001:80
  links: 
    - db
