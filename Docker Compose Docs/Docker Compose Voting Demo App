A Dockerfile is a simple text file that contains the commands a user could call to assemble an image whereas 
Docker Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. 
Docker Compose define the services that make up your app in docker-compose.


Docker Compose installation process for linux:
sudo(only if not a super user)curl -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.26.2/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)" -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose

Now set the executable permission to the binary file: sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose

Create a docker compose file with the name docker-compose.yml

Now we need to identiy all the services required and list them:
redis:
  image: redis
  

db: 
  image: postgres
  

vote:
  image: voting-app
  ports: 
    - 5000:80
  links:
    - redis

worker:
  image: worker-app
  links:
    - db
    - redis  

result:
  image: result-app
  ports: 5001:80
  links: 
    - db
