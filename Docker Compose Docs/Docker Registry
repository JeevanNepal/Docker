Docker registry:
A registry is a storage and content delivery system, holding named Docker images, available in different tagged 
versions. ... Users interact with a registry by using docker push and pull commands. Example: docker pull 
registry-1.docker.io/distribution/registry:2.1 . Storage itself is delegated to drivers.

It's a central repository of all docker images.
