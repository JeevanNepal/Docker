Docker:
Docker is a set of platform as a service products that uses OS-level virtualization to deliver software in packages called containers. 
Containers are isolated from one another and bundle their own software, libraries and configuration files; they can communicate with each other through well-defined channels.
It is a tool designed to make it easier to create, deploy and run applications by using containers.
Docker containers are lightweight alternative for virtual machine and it uses the host OS.

Docker is a software platform for building applications based on containers ï¿½ 
small and lightweight execution environments that make shared use of the operating system kernel but otherwise run in isolation from one another.

Docker Containers:
A container is a standard unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another.

  
Docker Container Image:
A Docker container image is a lightweight, standalone, executable package of software that includes everything needed to run an application.


Docker utilises LXC container:
LXC is an operating-system-level virtualization method for running multiple isolated Linux systems on a control host using a single Linux kernel.

Basic-Commands-on-Docker:
Commmand to remove docker images by force: docker rmi -f image(name).
 
 Run Command: Used to run the commands.
 
 attach & detach commands.
 attach command is used to run the docker container in foregroumf and docker detach command is used to run the docker container in backgroung.

rm is uesd to remove the container: eg, docker rm +container name or ID.& rmi is used to remove docker images, eg: docker rmi +images name ot ID.

docker pull command:
It pulls the images of the os but does not run it.

If we want to run the command inside the container than use the following:
1. Ientify the container.
2. docker exec (container ID) cat /etc/*release*

TAG:latest
It is used to run the other versions of the OS. Ex: docker run redis 4.0 instead of the latest version 5.0.


exec runs a command inside the crunning container.

Docker Has two editions:
Community & Enterprise Edition. 


How to create docker image of our own?
First of all install any OS in my case it's Python using Ubuntu OS.
